# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction Project

This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict whether a person has **diabetes** based on health-related features.  
The dataset used is `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`.

---

## üìå Project Overview
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train/test split for evaluation
- Train multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC / LinearSVC)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Voting Classifier (Ensemble)
  - Stacking Classifier (optional, for improved performance)
- Evaluate models with:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Save the **best performing model** using `pickle`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
````

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìä Dataset

* File: `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`
* Target column: `diabetes`
* Features: health-related attributes such as age, BMI, glucose level, etc.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Train Models

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate models:

```bash
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python train.py
```

### 2. Save Best Model

The best performing model (Random Forest or ensemble) is saved as:

```
Diabetes Detection.pkl
```

### 3. Load Saved Model

Example to load and use for prediction:

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load model
with open("Diabetes Detection.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Example prediction
sample = pd.DataFrame([[45, 28.5, 130, 1]], columns=["age", "bmi", "glucose", "gender"])
prediction = model.predict(sample)
print("Diabetes" if prediction[0] == 1 else "No Diabetes")
```

## üìà Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7953   |
| SVC (RBF)           | 0.7960   |
| Random Forest       | 0.8866 ‚úÖ |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.8379   |
| KNN                 | 0.8634   |
| Naive Bayes         | 0.7653   |
| Voting Classifier   | 0.8362   |

* **Best model**: Random Forest (‚âà 88.6% accuracy)
* Ensemble methods (Stacking/Soft Voting with weights) can improve results further.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn (if using SMOTE)
* matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
* jupyter (optional)

Install all with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`
* Try advanced boosting algorithms: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
* Deploy model using Flask / FastAPI as a web app
* Build interactive frontend (Streamlit or Dash)

‚ö° Question: Do you want me to also create a **`requirements.txt` file** for you (so anyone can install dependencies in one command)?
